Overview

This project focuses on predicting sourcing costs using machine learning models. It involves minimal preprocessing and model training to achieve accurate predictions.

Dataset Information

The dataset comprises sourcing information for various product combinations. Each row represents the sourcing of one unit of a particular product combination, with unique combinations consisting of attributes mentioned in Columns A, B, C, D, E, F.
Training Set: July 2020 to May 2021
Test Set: June 2021

Since each row represents one unit of sourcing, you'll find multiple rows with the same combination in the training dataset. 
The goal is to forecast the sourcing cost for June 2021 using the 11 months' data from June 2020 to May 2021.
